# Dynamic_Graph_Algorithm-SCC
The proposed approach employs an SCC (Strongly Connected Component) tree structure to represent the hierarchical organization of SCCs. This method includes both incremental and decremental components to update the SCC structure efficiently. The incremental component is responsible for handling edge insertions, while the decremental component manages edge deletions. This approach aims to avoid the need to recompute SCCs for the entire graph each time an update occurs.
