# Dynamic_Graph_Algorithm-SCC
Proposed approach uses an SCC tree structure to represent the hierarchical organization of SCCs. Incremental and Decremental components, updates the SCC structure. The incremental component handles edge insertions, while  decremental component manages edge deletions. This is to overcome the recomputation of SCC on whole graph again.
