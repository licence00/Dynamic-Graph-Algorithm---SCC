# Dynamic_Graph_Algorithm-SCC
The proposed approach employs an SCC (Strongly Connected Component) tree structure to represent the hierarchical organization of SCCs. This method includes both incremental and decremental components to update the SCC structure efficiently. The incremental component is responsible for handling edge insertions, while the decremental component manages edge deletions. This approach aims to avoid the need to recompute SCCs for the entire graph each time an update occurs.

Got it! Here's the revised README focusing solely on the description and information about the project:

# Parallel SCC Algorithm in CUDA

This project implements a parallel algorithm in CUDA to compute Strongly Connected Components (SCCs) in a directed graph. The CUDA implementation utilizes the indegree and outdegree of nodes and employs a forward and backward algorithm to identify SCCs starting from nodes with the highest degree.

## Additional Information

For more details about the project, including the tree creation and updates during edge insertions and deletions, please refer to the README files in their respective directories. The final report (report.pdf) and PowerPoint presentation contain detailed results produced by the algorithm.
